# Frame-depth.js
This simple javascript-based website generates a frame cross-section based on measurements provided.

Measurements are in inches.

Measurements should be in this format with a space between whole number and fraction:

1 1/16, 2 1/4, 1/8, 1 1/2

This calculator will not work if you input a decimal.
